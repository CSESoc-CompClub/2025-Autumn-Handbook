# Task 3.2: Create an instance of player

1. Outside of your class definition (in your main code), create a new player object!

    ### Hint:
    - Use the class name with brackets `()` to create a new object.
    - Save it into a variable called `player`.

2.  After you create the player instance, print out the playerâ€™s important properties to check they were created correctly.
    ### Hints:
        - Print the player's `sprite`
        - Print the player's `position_x`
        - Print the player's `position_y`
        - Print the player's `size`
