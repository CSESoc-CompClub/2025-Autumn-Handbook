# Task 1.1: Create Game Screen
Now that Pygame is ready, itâ€™s time to make your game window!

## Step 1: Screen Size

Before we make our game we need to set up the screen to display it!

Make a screen that is 800 pixels wide and 600 pixels tall. This should be under the
create constants comment

For example:
To make a screen that is 100 pixels wide and 200 pixels tall you could use this code
```python
WIDTH = 100
HEIGHT = 200
```

## Step 2: Set Up Your Game Window

Now you need to **tell Pygame to create a window** of that size.

Use the Pygame function `pygame.display.set_mode()`

---
# YOU CANNOT SEE YOUR SCREEN YET
You must **complete Task 1.2** first BEFORE YOU CAN SEE A SCREEN WHEN YOU RUN YOUR PYGAME!

Otherwise the window will crash immediately, AND YOU WON'T EVEN BE ABLE TO SEE IT!

# Checkpoint

- [ ] Two variables for width and height

- [ ] A screen object created using Pygame and your variables
