# Task 1.1: Make Python File

1. In VS Code, click on **File** and then **New File**

    ![File](../images/create_files/1.png)

    ![New File](../images/create_files/2.png)

    You should see something like this pop up **after you click 'New File'**
    ![Pop Up](../images/create_files/3.png)

2. Enter the name of your file (e.g. 'my_game.py')
    ![my_game.py](../images/create_files/5.png)

    <span style="font-size: 24px;">
    Note:  
        Itâ€™s super important to include .py at the end of the file name so VS Code knows it's Python code!
    </span>


3. Press **'ENTER'** and something looks like this should pop up
    ![my_game.py](../images/create_files/8.png)

4. Press **'Desktop'** and then **'Create File'** to save your file to the Desktop

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; gap: 10px">
    <img src="../images/create_files/6.png" width="40%" height="20%"/> 
    <img src="../images/create_files/7.png" width="40%" height="20%"/>
</div>

5. Congratulations! You have created you python file! You can now start coding :)
