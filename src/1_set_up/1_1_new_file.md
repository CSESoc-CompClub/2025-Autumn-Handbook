# Task 1.1: Make Python File

1. In VS Code, click on **File** and then **New File...**

    ![File](../images/create_files/1.png)

    ![New File](../images/create_files/2.png)

    You should see something like this pop up **after you cilck 'New File'**
    ![Pop Up](../images/create_files/3.png)

2. Enter the name of your file (e.g. 'my_game.py')
    ![my_game.py](../images/create_files/5.png)

    <span style="font-size: 24px;">```
    NOTE:  
        Itâ€™s super important to include **`.py`** at the end of the file name so VS Code knows it's Python code!
    ```</span>


3. Press **'ENTER'** and something looks like this should pop up
    ![my_game.py](../images/create_files/8.png)

4. Press **'Desktop'** and then **'Create File'** to save your file to the Desktop
![my_game.py](../images/create_files/6.png)     

![my_game.py](../images/create_files/7.png)

5. **AND NOW YOU HAVE CREATED YOUR PYTHON FILE!!! YOU CAN START CODING**
