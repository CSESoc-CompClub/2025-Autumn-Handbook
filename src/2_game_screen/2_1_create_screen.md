# Task 2.1: Create Game Screen

Before we make our game we need to set up the screen to display it!

1. Make a screen that is 800 pixels wide and 600 pixels tall

    For example:
    To make a screen that is 100 pixels wide and 200 pixels tall you could use this code

    ```python
        WIDTH = 100
        HEIGHT = 200
    ```
---
2. Create a window** of that size using the Pygame function `pygame.display.set_mode()`
---
## YOU CANNOT SEE YOUR SCREEN YET
You must **complete Task 1.2** first BEFORE YOU CAN SEE A SCREEN WHEN YOU RUN YOUR PYGAME!
---
## Checkpoint
- [ ] Two variables for width and height
- [ ] A screen object created using Pygame and your variables
