# Task 2.4: Add a Game Title and App Icon

Now letâ€™s make your game window even cooler!  
Instead of saying "pygame window" at the top, and have the snake as the icon you can give your game a **custom title** and a **custom icon**!

## Step 1: Set a Title for Your Game Window

You can change the text that appears at the very top of your game window.

```Hint:
- Use a Pygame function `ame.display.set_caption()`.
- Inside the brackets `(...)`, put the title you want in **quotation marks**
- Example title: `game.display.set_caption("My game")`
```

## Step 2: Set a Custom Icon for Your Game

You can also add a **picture** as the icon of your game

```Hint:
- First, you need to **load an image** using `pygame.image.load(...)`
- Then, use a Pygame function that sounds like **"display icon"** to set the image.
- The path to your icon should be something like this: "images/game_icon.png"
```
