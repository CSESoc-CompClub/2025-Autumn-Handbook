# Task 5.3: Show the score on the screen

## Step 1.

We need to render the score on the screen. Perhaps, we could do something like [`font.render()`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/font.html#pygame.font.Font.render) might help us...


## Step 2.
We now need to `blit` the text onto the screen. You can think of it as the previous step drew us the image, and now we need to 'put' it on the screen. Where might we put this function?

Use: 
```
screen.blit(Surface, Coordinate)
```
