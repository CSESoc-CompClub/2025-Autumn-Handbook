# Task 0.2: Make Python File

Now that you have VS Code open, it’s time to create your Python file!

In VS Code, click on **File**

    ![File](../images/create_files/1.png)

and then New File...
    ![New File](../images/create_files/2.png)

You should see something like this pop up after you cilck 'New File'
    ![Pop Up](../images/create_files/3.png)

Enter the name of your file (e.g. 'my_game.py')
    ![my_game.py](../images/create_files/5.png)
    <span style="font-size: 24px;">```
    NOTE:  
        It’s super important to include **`.py`** at the end of the file name so VS Code knows it's Python code!
    ```</span>


Press **'ENTER'** and something looks like this should pop up
    ![my_game.py](../images/create_files/8.png)

Press **'Desktop'** and then **'Create File'** to save your file to the Desktop
![my_game.py](../images/create_files/6.png)     

![my_game.py](../images/create_files/7.png)

**AND NOW YOU HAVE CREATED YOUR PYTHON FILE!!! YOU CAN START CODING**
![my_game.py](../images/create_files/9.png)
