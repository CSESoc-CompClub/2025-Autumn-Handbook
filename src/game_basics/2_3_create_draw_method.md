# Task 2.3: Create the draw method

Under the player method, we need to create a draw method().
How might we create a method inside a class? If you are stuck have a read [here](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_classes.asp).

Perhaps the [`screen.blit(...)`](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/pygame-surface-blit-function/) function could be useful...

Now, in order for the player position to be updated very often, where would we call this draw method?
