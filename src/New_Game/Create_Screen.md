# Task 1.1: Create Game Screen

Now that Pygame is ready, itâ€™s time to make your game window!

<span style="font-size: 24px;">**Follow these steps carefully!**</span>

---

## Step 1: Think About the Screen Size

Before creating a game window, you need to decide:

- How wide should the screen be?
- How tall should the screen be?

âœ… Let's create **two variables** to store these numbers!

<span style="font-size: 20px;">âœ¨ Hint:</span>  
Use easy-to-remember names like **`screen_size_x`** and **`screen_size_y`**.

For example:
- `screen_size_x` could be **800** (pixels wide)
- `screen_size_y` could be **600** (pixels tall)

---

## Step 2: Set Up Your Game Window

Now that you have the screen size saved inside variables,  
you need to **tell Pygame to create a window** of that size.

âœ… Use the Pygame function that starts with `pygame.display.`...

âœ… There's a function that sounds like "**set mode**" â€” itâ€™s the one you want!

---

### ðŸš€ Your mission:

- Use `screen_size_x` and `screen_size_y`
- Use a Pygame function to **create the window**
- Save the result into a variable called `screen`

âœ… After you complete this task, you should have a real Pygame window popping up!

---

## Step 3: Test If It Works

After setting up your screen, **run your program** (BUT NOT YET â€” WAIT UNTIL TASK 1.2)!  
(You need the game loop first in Task 1.2, or the window will crash!)

âœ… Your code should not crash.  
âœ… Your program should be ready to open a blank window after the next task.

---

# ðŸ§  What You Should Have (By the End of Task 1.1)

âœ… Two variables for width and height

âœ… A screen object created using Pygame and your variables

âœ… A clean setup without hard-coding numbers inside `set_mode`!

---

# âœ¨ Remember!

| What you want | How to think about it |
|:--------------|:---------------------|
| Width of screen | Saved in `screen_size_x` |
| Height of screen | Saved in `screen_size_y` |
| Game window creation | Use a Pygame function that \"sets\" the screen mode |

âœ… Use variables for your screen size â€” don't type raw numbers directly!

---

# ðŸš¨ DO NOT RUN YET!

After Task 1.1, your file is **almost ready**,  
but you must **complete Task 1.2** first (the game loop)  
before running your program!

Otherwise the window will crash immediately!

---

# ðŸŽ‰ YOU'RE DOING AMAZING!

After you finish Task 1.1 and 1.2,  
you'll see your first real Pygame window pop up! ðŸš€
