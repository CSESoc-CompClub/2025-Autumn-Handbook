# Task 1.1: Create Game Screen
Now that Pygame is ready, it’s time to make your game window!
## Step 1: Screen Size

Before we make our game we need to set up the screen to display it on!
1. Make a screen that is 800 pixels wide and 600 pixels tall. This should be under the
create constants comment

2. Run your code! Do you see a big dark box?

For example:
To make a screen that is 100 pixels wide and 200 pixels tall you could use this code
```python
WIDTH = 100
HEIGHT = 200
```

## Step 2: Set Up Your Game Window

Now that you have the screen size saved inside variables,  
you need to **tell Pygame to create a window** of that size.

Use the Pygame function that starts with `pygame.display.`...

There's a function that sounds like "**set mode**" — it’s the one you want!

# YOU CANNOT SEE YOUR SCREEN YET

After Task 1.1, your file is **almost ready**,  
but you must **complete Task 1.2** first (the game loop)  
BEFORE YOU CAN SEE A SCREEN WHEN YOU RUN YOUR PYGAME!

Otherwise the window will crash immediately, AND YOU WON'T EVEN BE ABLE TO SEE IT!
